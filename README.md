# Fake_instagram_account_detection
This project focuses on detecting fake Instagram accounts using a machine learning model. The system analyzes user profile features such as profile picture availability, username structure, bio length, number of posts, followers, and following count. A dataset of real and fake account examples was used to train the model, enabling it to identify suspicious patterns. The model was then integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit web app. Users can input account details and instantly receive predictions indicating whether the account is likely real or fake. This tool aims to support social media transparency and reduce the impact of fake profiles.
